# Shortest-Path-Finding-Algorithm
Created an  application which shows shortest path between 2 destinations with the implementation of Astar Algorithm.
Astar is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.
One major practical drawback is its O(b^d) space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory
